 <h2>My top 3 TV Show of all-time!</h2>
 <hr/>

 <h3>1. Game of Thrones</h3>
 <p>This epic saga has set the bar incredibly high for television shows, captivating audiences worldwide with its intricate plotlines, unforgettable characters, and breathtaking production value. From the very first episode, Game of Thrones grabs hold of your attention and refuses to let go.</p>
 
 <h3>2. Breaking Bad</h3>
 <p>Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.</p>

 <h3>3. The Wire</h3>
 <p>One of the major reasons that The Wire receives so much attention from audiences is because it's just as focused on its criminals as it is on those called to serve and protect. Characters like Stringer Bell, Marlo Stanfield, and Omar were complex figures and incredibly hard to stereotype.</p>
